            <h2>Cooking Steps</h2>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Fold together bread crumbs, cream, stock and egg and leave to rest for about 5 minutes. Fry the onion in the butter until soft, then mix it with the breadcrumb cream. Add salt, pepper and mince and work everything together with your hands or fork. Try not to work it too much, as this will make the meatballs compact.</li>
                        <li>Take a small piece of mince and fry it to test the flavours. When satisfied with salt and pepper, roll the rest of the mince into small balls (about one tablespoon of mince per ball). Make sure your hands are wet with water so that the mince wonâ€™t stick to your hands.</li>
                        <li>Fry the meatballs until golden brown and thoroughly cooked, then put aside.</li>
                        <li>Mix cream and cornstarch; then pour this, the stock and the soy into the pan where you fried the meatballs. Whisk through the pan and let boil for a couple of minutes. Taste with salt, pepper and jam for a little bit of sweetness.</li>
                        <li>Put the meatballs back into the sauce and serve with mashed potatoes, lingonberry jam, and maybe some chopped parsley.</li>
                    </ol>
