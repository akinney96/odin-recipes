            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
                <h3>Pancakes:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>2 cups whole milk</li>
                    <li>3/4 cups wheat flour</li>
                    <li>2 tsp salt</li>
                    <li>1 large egg</li>
                    <li>800g potatoes, julienned</li>
                    <li>Butter to fry in</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>For serving:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Bacon or salted pork, fried and thinly sliced</li>
                    <li>Lingonberry jam</li>
                </ul>
            <h2>Cooking Steps</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Whisk together milk and flour in a bowl. Mix eggs and salt. Grate the potatoes on the fine or coarse part (more a matter of taste and what you like) of a grater and mix them into the batter. Let it rest for 30 minutes before frying the potato pancakes.</li>
                    <li>Heat a generous dollop of butter in a frying pan. Pour about ½ cup of batter into the pan and fry to a thick pancake (about as thick as American pancakes), think about spreading the batter over the frying pan so that the grated potatoes are evenly spread throughout the "pancake" and not only as a pile in the middle. Fry on medium heat on both sides until the pancake is golden brown and crispy on the edges. Be careful not to overheat so that they get colour before the potatoes are actually cooked, it takes about 4 minutes per side.</li>
                    <li>Place the pancakes on a plate or in a baking dish and put them in the oven to keep them heated at about 75°C (165°F).</li>
                    <li>Serve the warm potato pancakes with fried bacon or pork and lingonberry jam.</li>
                </ol>
